//! Sentinel cryptographically confirms the origin of a claim in a decentralised network.
//!
//! A claim has to implement Claimable in order to be verifiable and mergeable.
//! A request has to implement GetSigningKeys such that Sentinel can acquire
//! the necessary public signing keys.
//! The request is passed immutably through sentinel
//! and is used as a key to group claims and corresponding keys.
//! When sentinel resolves a threshold on verified and merged message,
//! it returns the requester key and the merged claim.
//! Claimant names and associated signatures are discarded after successful resolution,
//! as such abstracting the original request into a resolved claim.
//!
//! The keys_threshold specifies a minimal threshold on the number of independent mentions of
//! a single public signing key needed to consider it for verifying a claim.  This threshold
//! can be one or higher.
//! The claims_threshold specifies a minimal threshold on the number of verified claims before
//! sentinel will attempt to merge these verified claims.
